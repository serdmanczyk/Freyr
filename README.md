# What?

A pet project to design a simple garden sensor and custom server for aggregating data and providing a simple user interface.

- Nginx gateway for scaling, static file hosting, and SSL termination
- Golang API backend 
- ReactJS single page web app
- Postgres database
- Docker driven integration tests and deployment
- More buzzwords as I can add them in, sorry no Haskell in the foreseeable future

# Why?

The intent is to merge my interests in sustainability, backend system software development, embedded programming, and electronics tinkering while providing the opportunity to practice with programming techniques I may not get to use as much as I like during my day-job.

# Etymology

[Freyr (Fray-ur)][freyr], the Norse god associated with fertility, sunshine, and fair weather.  The CLI testing tool is named after [Surtr][surtr], the fire giant who battles Freyr to his death at Ragnarök.

The symbol is the Futhark [ᚠ (Fehu)][fehu] (Norse 'F') imposed on a leaf, resembling the leaf's veins.  Seen above, it takes the place of the 'F' in Freyr.
